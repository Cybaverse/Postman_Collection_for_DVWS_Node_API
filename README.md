# Postman_Collection_for_DVWS_Node_API

We like the repo https://github.com/snoopysecurity/dvws-node for API training, shout out to Sam Sanoop, but found it beneficial to avoid the use of the HTML layer.

The postman collection found in this repo can help do just that. You can create your own user on the endpoint POST http://dvws.local/apiv2/users. 

Note we added a script to import the JWT when you login for the use on other endpoints. However, you will need to set up a environmental variable called "jwt_token" for it to import. 

Happy Hacking.
